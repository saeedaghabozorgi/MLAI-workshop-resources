    "## An Introduction to Linear Learner\n",

    "Welcome to our example introducing Amazon SageMaker's Linear Learner Algorithm!  Today, we use the Boston Housing dataset, present in Scikit-Learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#boston-dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that we'll use is a linear regression model.  Linear models are supervised learning algorithms used for solving either classification or regression problems.  As input, the model is given labeled examples ( **`x`**, `y`). **`x`** is a high dimensional vector and `y` is a numeric label.  Since we are doing regression, the algorithm expects the label to be be continuous values.  The algorithm learns a linear function, mapping the vector **`x`** to an approximation of the label `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker's Linear Learner algorithm extends upon typical linear models by training many models in parallel, in a computationally efficient manner.  Each model has a different set of hyperparameters, and then the algorithm finds the set that optimizes a specific criteria. This can provide substantially more accurate models than typical linear algorithms at the same, or lower, cost.\n",

    "To get started, we need to set up the environment with a few prerequisite steps, for permissions, configurations, and so on.\n",

    "when building a model whose primary goal is to predict a target value on new data, it is important to prevent overfitting. The most common way of preventing this is to build models with the concept that a model shouldn't only be judged on its fit to the data it was trained on, but also on \"new\" data.  There are several different ways of operationalizing this, holdout validation, cross-validation, leave-one-out validation, etc.  For our purposes, we'll simply randomly split the data into 3 uneven groups.  The model will be trained on 70% of data, it will then be evaluated on 20% of data to give us an estimate of the accuracy we hope to have on \"new\" data, and 10% will be held back as a final testing dataset which will be used later on."
